# TODO
- Debugging/ Logging / Error Handling
- New mechanics/items/conditions/etc
- Documentation/Proper Versions

- Action Cost needs to be its own mechanic, ensuring the action is not performed if the player does not have enough action to perform it.

# Bio
Welcome to Duel, where you collect magical artifacts, weapons, clothes, and tools to aid in your battle against your arch-nemesis, your best friend! Your once beloved comrade has turned their back on you, all in the name of evil! Or is it good? Oh well, you two have always had something to fight about, so get at it!

# Gameplay                 
- Players have Action Points that may be spent on their turn to perform various actions.
- Players also have an inventory that contains various items to assist them against their foe. Certain items may be equipped to grant various stats or skills.
- Players have a health pool. Once reduced to zero, the game is over, and their opponent wins.
- To obtain new items, players will reach into the Endless Bag. Here, they have a random chance of finding most items in the game. Players may choose additional locations to boost the chances of finding certain items for certain builds.

# Ideas
Rarer items have lower chances of being found, but players may select their next drawing location to alter their chances for various items.
