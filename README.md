Welcome to Duel, where you collect magical artifacts, weapons, clothes, and tools to aid in your battle against your arch-nemesis, your best friend!

                Gameplay                 
===========================================

Players have Action Points which may be spent on their turn to perform various actions.

Players also have an inventory which contains various items to assist them against their foe. Certain items may be equipped to grant various stats or skills.

Players have a health pool. Once reduced to zero, the game is over, and their opponent wins.

To obtain new items, players will reach into the Endless Bag. Here, they have a random chance of finding most items in the game. Perhaps players may choose additional locations to boost chances of finding certain items for certain builds.
